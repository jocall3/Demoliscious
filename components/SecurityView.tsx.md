# The Story of `SecurityView.tsx`: The Fortress

Welcome to the Fortress. This is the high-security chamber of Demo Bank, the place where the user, "The Visionary," manages the locks, keys, and guardians of their financial kingdom. It's a realm of control, transparency, and peace of mind.

## The Gates: `Linked Accounts & Data Sources`

The first and most important area of the Fortress is the gatehouse. Here, the user manages the connections to the outside world.

-   **Plaid Integration**: The primary gate is controlled by Plaid. The `PlaidLinkButton` is a heavily guarded portal that opens a high-fidelity simulation of the Plaid Link modal. This is how the user grants Demo Bank permission to securely import data from their other financial institutions. It is the bridge to the wider world.
-   **Account Management**: Once linked, each account is displayed as a clear entry, showing the institution's name and the account mask. A small, red "Unlink" button serves as a powerful control, allowing the user to sever the connection at any time, instantly revoking access. This is a declaration of the user's ultimate authority over their own data.

## The Walls: `Security Settings`

This section allows the user to fortify the walls of their account.

-   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: A powerful magical ward. The user can activate this with a satisfyingly tactile toggle switch, adding a second layer of defense to their login process.
-   **Biometric Login**: The most personal and secure lock. By enabling this, the user decrees that the only key to their account is their own physical selfâ€”their face or fingerprint.
-   **Change Password**: The chamber where the user can forge a new secret key, the traditional password. This opens a modal for secure entry of their old and new credentials.

## The Watchtower: `Recent Login Activity`

The Fortress has a watchtower that keeps a vigilant eye on all who enter. This section displays a clear, simple log of recent login activity. It shows the device, the location, and the time of each access. It is a transparent record that allows the user to easily spot any unfamiliar activity, ensuring that no one enters their kingdom unannounced.

The `SecurityView` is a place of power and control. It is designed to be clear, unambiguous, and empowering. It demystifies security and places the ultimate authority in the hands of the user, making them the true master of their fortress.
