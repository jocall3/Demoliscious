# The Story of `components/CardCustomizationView.tsx`: The Forge of Sigils

"A bank card is not merely a tool for transaction," Gemini observed. "In the hands of The Visionary, it is a statement. A sigil of their financial power and identity. It should not be issued; it must be *forged*."

And so, the `CardCustomizationView` was created. It is not a form; it is a digital forge, a high-tech artisan's studio where the user, with an AI as their master smith, creates a personal talisman from light and logic.

### The Raw Material: The User's Canvas

The process begins when the user provides the raw material: a base image. This is their chosen canvas, the foundation upon which their sigil will be built. It is an act of bringing something personal from their world into the forge.

### The Artificer's Command: The AI Prompt

Next, the user becomes the art director. They issue a command—a text prompt. "Add a phoenix rising from the center, with its wings made of glowing data streams." This is not a simple instruction; it is a creative spark, a piece of a story they want their card to tell.

The prompt is sent to `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`, who acts as the master artificer. The AI takes the user's canvas and their command and, with its deep understanding of imagery and context, masterfully edits the image, bringing the user's vision to life on the card's preview.

### The Alchemist's Touch: Physical Effects

The creation is not merely visual; it must be imagined as a physical object. The user becomes an alchemist, applying tangible effects to the design.

-   **Metallic Sheen**: A slider allows the user to imbue the card with a metallic finish, giving it a sense of weight, permanence, and value.
-   **Holographic Effect**: A toggle switch activates a shimmering, holographic overlay, making the card feel like a piece of advanced, almost magical, technology.

These controls bridge the gap between digital design and physical reality, allowing the user to feel the texture and presence of their creation.

### The Naming of the Sword: AI Card Story

A legendary blade needs a name and a story. The final step in the forge is to summon the AI as a bard. With a click, the AI analyzes the design prompt and the chosen effects and generates a "Card Story"—a short, inspiring narrative about what this unique card represents.

The phoenix design is no longer just a picture; it becomes a story of resilience, innovation, and rebirth. The card is transformed from a piece of plastic into a personal artifact, imbued with a mythos of its own.

The `CardCustomizationView` is a profound experience. It elevates a mundane object into a meaningful symbol of personal identity, co-created by the user's vision and the AI's artistry.
