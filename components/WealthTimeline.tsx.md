# The Story of `WealthTimeline.tsx`: The Oracle's Window

In the Dashboard's command center, there exists a unique portal, a window that does not look out onto the world, but through time itself. The `WealthTimeline` component is this Oracle's Window. It grants the user the power of foresight, showing them not just the path they have walked, but the potential roads that lie ahead.

## The Art of Scrying: `useMemo` and Calculation

The window's magic is forged within a `useMemo` hook, a chamber of efficient calculation. Here, the timeline's story is woven from the raw threads of transaction data:

1.  **The Past is Written**: The component first walks the path of history, calculating the user's running balance from their very first transaction to their last. This creates a solid, factual record of their wealth journey.

2.  **The Future is Calculated**: The true power of the oracle lies in its ability to project. It analyzes the user's recent financial velocityâ€”the average net gain or loss over the last few months. Using this momentum, it charts a probable course for the next six months, creating a data-driven projection of their potential future wealth.

## The Vision in the Window: The `ComposedChart`

The story of past and future is painted within the window using a `ComposedChart`, a sophisticated tool that can layer multiple visions at once.

-   **The Past (`Area` chart)**: The user's historical balance is rendered as a solid `Area` chart, filled with a beautiful cyan gradient. It is depicted as a solid landscape, a tangible history that has already occurred.

-   **The Future (`Line` chart)**: The projected balance is rendered as a dashed `Line` chart. The choice of a dashed line is deliberate and profound. It signifies that this future is not set in stone; it is a *potential*, a possibility based on current trends. It is a path that can be altered.

-   **The Legend**: A clear `Legend` explains the meaning of the solid and dashed lines, distinguishing between the certainty of history and the possibility of the future.

The `WealthTimeline` is a powerful tool of empowerment. It gives the user a unique perspective, allowing them to see the consequences of their past actions and the potential outcomes of their future ones. It transforms them from a simple passenger to the navigator of their own financial destiny, armed with a map of both where they have been and where they might go.
