# The Story of `types.ts`: The Laws of Physics

Every universe, no matter how magical, must have rules. It needs a language to describe its reality, a set of unbreakable laws that define what can and cannot exist. In the universe of Demo Bank, `types.ts` is that set of laws. It is the application's grand codex, its laws of physics, its language of reality.

This file does not contain logic; it contains truth.

## Defining the Elements

Here, the fundamental elements of the financial world are given form and name.

-   **`Transaction`**: This is the law of value in motion. It declares that every transaction must have a `type` (income or expense), a `category`, a `description`, an `amount`, and a `date`. It even allows for a `carbonFootprint`, acknowledging that every action has a consequence. This is the atom of the financial world.

-   **`Asset`**: This is the law of stored value. It defines what it means to be an asset: a `name`, a `value`, a `color` for visualization, and perhaps even an `esgRating` to measure its virtue.

-   **`AIInsight`**: This is the law of wisdom. It defines how the AI's knowledge is to be structured: with a `title`, a `description`, and a measure of `urgency`, so its whispers can be properly understood.

## Defining the States of Being

The codex goes deeper, defining not just objects, but states of being and complex concepts.

-   **`View`**: This is the law of perspective. It is an `enum` that lists every possible place the user can be within the application. From the `Dashboard` to the `QuantumWeaver` to the `CorporateCommand` center, this type ensures that navigation is not a chaotic journey, but a well-defined path between known states. It is the map of the universe.

-   **`QuantumWeaverState`**: This defines the journey of an idea. It describes the `stage` a business plan can be in, from a simple `Pitch` to the glorious moment of being `Approved`. It holds the `businessPlan` itself, the AI's `feedback`, and the resulting `coachingPlan`. It is the law of creation.

-   **`FinancialGoal`**: This is the law of aspiration. It defines what a dream looks like in the language of this world: a `name`, a `targetAmount`, a `targetDate`, and the `currentAmount` saved. It also allows for an `AIGoalPlan`, the AI-generated map to that dream.

## The Great Contract

`types.ts` serves as the great contract for the entire application. Every component, every function, every piece of data must adhere to these laws. When a component expects a `Transaction`, this file is the authority on what that `Transaction` must contain.

It prevents chaos. It ensures order. It allows a complex system of interconnected components to communicate with perfect clarity, because they all speak the same, well-defined language. It is the silent, rigorous grammar that makes the beautiful poetry of the UI possible. It is the foundational logic upon which the entire world of Demo Bank rests.
